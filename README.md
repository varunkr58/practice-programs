I add the solved competitive question's solution here.

GraphArrayList.java -implement Undirected Graph to find the vertices that that are intersection point for other vertices, which aren't connected directly.
For Example in below Graph - 1,3 and 5 are intersection points. 4 isn't because to reach 6, it can take path [4,5,6] or even a direct path [4,6].
